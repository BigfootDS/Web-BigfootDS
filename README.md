# BigfootDS Website

HTML, CSS, JS, and other files relevant to the BigfootDS website.

This is currently deployed to:

- [web-staging.bigfootds.dev](https://web-staging.bigfootds.dev/)

## Purpose

Purpose of the repo: education!

Purpose of the web-app: business!

I need a web client for the back-ends that I'm building so that my customers (of my videogames) can do appropriate things with their user data and game data.

Building this as a classroom example / optional extra-curricular example project means that:

1. I can create time to work on this thing.
2. I can show students some cool functionalities and ways of working.

The repository of this front-end web-app is publicly visible since it holds no API keys or other sensitive data - the back-end servers / microservices will remain private though, as they do have keys and security logic that would become useless if it were public. White-label projects of the back-ends will be made during classes, it's really not special - but things like the JWT decryption keys cannot be shared.

## Build Your Own

This project is based on the "Astro Starter Kit: Blog" project template. Make your own with this command in your NodeJS-ready terminal:

```sh
npm create astro@latest -- --template blog
```

Features:

- âœ… Minimal styling (make it your own!)
- âœ… 100/100 Lighthouse performance
- âœ… SEO-friendly with canonical URLs and OpenGraph data
- âœ… Sitemap support
- âœ… RSS Feed support
- âœ… Markdown & MDX support

This project does have a few other things added to it beyond the basic blog template, but you can compare the differences yourself as part of your education. Things like `package.json` and any config files will be very worthwhile to dig into! ðŸ˜‰
