## Tech Stack

Prototyping in progress! Still settling on a tech stack that would let us use entity component systems (ECS) to enable complex data-driven gameplay.

Unity was promising until its business decisions made it too risky to rely on.
Godot looks promising, but more research (from our side of  things) must be done before we settle on it.
Using Tauri or ElectronJS and rolling our own ECS or database-driven systems is a thought, but not ideal compared to a dedicated game engine.

## Game Overview

Explore your way around infinite worlds full of flourishing flora, brilliant bees, and long-forgotten wonders. You & your friends can rebuild the world together while collecting & growing a massive variety of flora & bees!
