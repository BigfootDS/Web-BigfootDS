Sourcepool is a tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) content management system, ready for you to self-host.

<ComingSoon />

## Quick Info

## The what

Essentially:

1. Player A has Sourcepool installed on their computer.
2. Dungeon Master has Sourcepool installed on their computer.
3. Dungeon Master adds content to their Sourcepool.
4. Dungeon Master allows other Sourcepool servers (eg. the players' Sourcepools) to connect to their own Sourcepool.
5. Player A can control, create, and edit a character that lives on the DM's Sourcepool.
6. Player A can disconnect from the DM's Sourcepool and keep a read-only copy of the DM's Sourcepool content.

Other things like configuration of what content is and isn't viewable by players can be configured, as well as offline annotations or changes (eg. a player changing things in their local copy of their character, which can then resynchronise with the DM's Sourcepool later) and more, can also happen.

## Is Sourcepool in the cloud?

No.

This is intended as a LAN/WLAN system. 

If you're tech-savvy, you can look into port-forwarding and other IP address configurations to make a Sourcepool server work on the public internet and deploy your own Sourcepool instance to the cloud - but that's all stuff you would do on your own, and is not a part of this app.

As developers of Sourcepool, we are not spending any dev time or effort on cloud or internet connectivity at this stage (July 2024). Offline-first usability and LAN/WLAN connectivity are our focuses.
