## Game Overview

Become the ultimate patron of power in your own fantasy world! Build your gathering of followers, manipulate the mortal realm and grow your godhood to become the highest power in reality.



As an ambitious magical patron, it's up to you to choose your path to the pinnacle of power. Answer or ignore prayers. Create allies or enemies out of the existing patrons and deific powers. Steal, siphon, scavenge, and more to collect arcane power and grow as an emerging godly entity.




#### GROW FROM CULT TO CHURCH



Begin your journey to godhood with a tiny cult, and expand until you’re a widely-revered deity!




#### MAKE AND MANIPULATE MYTHS AND LEGENDS

Twist the beliefs of people around the world - grow your own mythos, or even sabotage other patrons and deities.




#### CULTIVATE YOUR CHAMPIONS, ARTEFACTS, AND MORE

Infuse the world with morsels of your power, investing in the world and yourself with longer-term plans and strategies to ensure your deific reign.




#### BECOME THE SUPREME BEING ABOVE ALL OTHERS

Rise above all other patrons, deities, and anything in-between to become the ultimate power. Consume, obliterate, or partner with whoever you must along the way - just make sure that you’re the one at the pinnacle of reality when you’re done.
